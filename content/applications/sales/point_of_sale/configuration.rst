PoS product categories

POS product categories allow users to categorize products and get a more structured and clean
POS interface.

To manage PoS categories, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> PoS Product
Categories`. To add a new category, click :guilabel:`Create`. Then, name it in the
