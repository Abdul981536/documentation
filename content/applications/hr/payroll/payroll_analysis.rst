Line chart
~~~~~~~~~~

A line chart is the default view for the *Payroll* report. If a different view is selected, click
the :guilabel:`Line Chart` button (represented by a :guilabel:`üìà (chart increasing)` icon) in the
menu bar to change the view back to a line chart.

Several options are available for the line chart. Click the corresponding button to activate the
selection, and change the way the data is presented. These icons appear at the end of the chart
options. The various options are:

.. _payroll/stacked:

- :guilabel:`Stacked`: data is presented with each metric in its own line, "stacked" on top of each
  other. This helps visualize the distribution and variances between different categories.

.. _payroll/cumulative:

- :guilabel:`Cumulative`: data is presented with each metric on an individual line, with the total
  amount calculated by combining all the lines. This provides a comprehensive view of the cumulative
  data.

.. _payroll/descending:

- :guilabel:`Descending`: data is shown with the largest values on the left side of the chart,
  gradually decreasing towards the smallest values on the right side, along the x-axis. This
  arrangement helps emphasize trends or outliers at the extremes.

.. _payroll/ascending:

- :guilabel:`Ascending`: data is presented with the smallest values on the left side of the chart,
  increasing towards the largest values on the right side, along the x-axis. This arrangement can be
  useful for highlighting progressive growth or trends.

.. note::
   These options can be combined to create a variety of views.
